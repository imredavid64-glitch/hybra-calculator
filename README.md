# hybra-calculator
A useful scientific, graphing, and open source modifiable calculator with a differentiable LLM agent to adjust in the code to your needs.
All that needs to be done to use this is to download the file and run it in IDLE Python, and if you want to modify the AI agent, then you can open that up in a editing software to code it differently to your modified need.
